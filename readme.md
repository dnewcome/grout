Grout is a parametric guitar body routing template generator.
It's intended to take an SVG outline and add parametric paths for routing the neck pocket and cavities for pickups and electronics.


Usage:

In order to use grout we need to know the scale length of the neck and the offset to the 20th fret. The origin of the guitar will be the center of the neck at the 20th fret. This generally conicides with a 22 fret fender strat neck and may need to be adjusted for other types of guitar.

Humbucker rings

Necks generally have a bit of taper on the heel. This can be measured and plugged into the heel slot calculation.

Guitar body shapes
Generated shapes should be svg files with the origin at the center of the neck pocket.
